## Solving problems given on the popular sit

### Exercise 1 (split_string.cpp)

``` Complete the solution so that it splits the string into pairs of two characters. If the string contains an odd number of characters then it should replace the missing second character of the final pair with an underscore ('_').

Examples:

* 'abc' =>  ['ab', 'c_']
* 'abcdef' => ['ab', 'cd', 'ef']
```

Takes user input, enter a string, and it will split the string as required. 


### Exercise 2 (revwords.cpp)

``` Complete the function that accepts a string parameter, and reverses each word in the string. All spaces in the string should be retained.

Examples
"This is an example!" ==> "sihT si na !elpmaxe"
"double  spaces"      ==> "elbuod  secaps"
```

Takes user input, enter a string, and it will reverse each word while keeping it in the same index.

Reversing the entire string would have been trivial of course, even without 'reverse', but this is slightly more involved.
