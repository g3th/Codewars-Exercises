## Solving problems given on the popular sit

### Exercise 1 -

``` Complete the solution so that it splits the string into pairs of two characters. If the string contains an odd number of characters then it should replace the missing second character of the final pair with an underscore ('_').

Examples:

* 'abc' =>  ['ab', 'c_']
* 'abcdef' => ['ab', 'cd', 'ef']
```

Takes user input, enter a string, and it will split the string as required. 

This will not work on the site, mostly due to "using namespace std" and other stupid stuff which they don't allow (for some reason).
